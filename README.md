# WebAPI
Create Todo items, update and delete them. Get an overview of all Items, and a few other basic features. This kind of app is essentially a "Hello World".


Below are the user stories, which we will implement

- As a user of the system I can add a new User, so that Todos can be assigned to Users.
- As a User I can get a list of all existing Users, so that I can assign Todos to them
- As a User I can add a new Todo, so that I can remember important things
- As a User I can view all or filtered Todos, so that I can remember what to do
- As a User I can complete a Todo, so that I can mark things as done
- As a User I can delete a Todo, so that I can clean up
